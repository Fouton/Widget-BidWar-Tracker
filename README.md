# Widget-BidWar-Tracker
A widget to be used on StreamElements for streamers to track donations/earnings as points to be allocated to goals. Unfortunately the Chat functionality is not capable within StreamElements Overlay formats, and this will need to be ported into Elements(Beta) when it is fully fleshed out.

### Installing
Open https://streamelements.com/dashboard/overlays and create a new overlay page.
Press the + and under Static/Custom choose Custom Widget.
On the left bar, select the widget and then hit settings, followed by OPEN EDITOR

Copy the text of each file in this repo into each corresponding tab of the widget's editor.
